Welcome to the NOAA Fisheries workshop focused on geospatial analysis using ocean 'big data'. Today, we are focused on using data from NASA [EarthData](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) but the skills you will learn are transferable to other ways that you might get earth data (e.g., NESDIS, NCEI, ERDDAP servers, Copernicus).

This workshop is focused on those who are brand new to working with earth data in the cloud and with geospatial packages. R users will be introduced to the `earthdatalogin`, `terra` and `sf` packages, while Python users will be introduced to the `earthaccess` and `xarray` packages.  This workshop will also introduce working with [JupyterHubs](https://jupyter.org/hub). We will use both Jupyter Lab (Python) and RStudio (R) within our JupyterHub. 

## Topics for May 15, 2024

* Introduction to working with earth data in the cloud and NASA Earth Data
* Orientation on our JupyterHub
* Tutorial 1: Searching for resources in NASA Earthdata
* Tutorial 2: Plotting and subsetting earth data
* Tutorial 3: Masking and aggregating your earth data within a region (shapefiles)

## Resources

* [CoastWatch GitHub organization](https://github.com/coastwatch-training) for many more training modules for working with satellite data in Python and R
* [NASA EarthData Cloudbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/) for many tutorials on using satellite data in Python and R and NASA Earth Data
* [NMFS Friday HackHours](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAAHackDays/)
