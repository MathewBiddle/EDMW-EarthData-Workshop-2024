title: "EDMW 2024 - Workshop 3B"
subtitle: "Introduction to using earth data in the cloud for scientific workflows"
---

Welcome to the NOAA Fisheries workshop focused on geospatial analysis using ocean 'big data'. Today, we are focused on using data from NASA [EarthData](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/) but the skills you will learn are transferable to other ways that you might get earth data, e.g. NESDIS, NCEI, ERDDAP servers, Copernicus, etc.

This session will also introduce to working with JupyterHubs. We will use both Jupyter Lab (Python) and RStudio (R) within our JupyterHub. Go to [set-up](setup.html) for the basic orientation and how to get on the JupyterHub.
