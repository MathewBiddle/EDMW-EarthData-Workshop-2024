# Extract data within a boundary

## Background
One use for satellite observations is to supplement in situ sampling of geographical locations where the timespan, frequency measurements, spatial dimensions or remoteness of the locations, make physical sampling impossible or impractical. One drawback is that satellite data are often rectangular, whereas geographical locations can have irregular boundaries. Examples of boundaries include marine protected areas or marine physical, biological, and ecological divisions like the Longhurst Marine Provinces.  

## Objectives
In this tutorial we will learn how to download a timeseries of SST satellite data from an ERDDAP server, and then mask the data to retain only the data within an irregular geographical boundary (polygon). We will then plot a yearly seasonal cycle from within the boundary. 

## The tutorial demonstrates the following techniques
-   Downloading data from an ERDDAP data server for a non-rectangular region using the *rerddapXtracto* package
-   Visualizing data on a map
-   Plotting a time-series of mean SST 

## Datasets used
__GHRSST Level 4 AVHRR_OI Global Blended Sea Surface Temperature Analysis (GDS2) from NCEI__    
This NOAA blended SST is a moderate resolution satellite-based gap-free sea surface temperature (SST) product. We will use the daily data.
https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C2036881712-POCLOUD.html

__Longhurst Marine Provinces__  
The dataset represents the division of the world oceans into provinces as defined by Longhurst (1995; 1998; 2006). This division has been based on the prevailing role of physical forcing as a regulator of phytoplankton distribution. The Longhurst Marine Provinces dataset is available online (https://www.marineregions.org/downloads.php) and within the shapes folder associated with this repository. For this tutorial we will use the Gulf Stream province (ProvCode: GFST)

## Load packages

```{r}
library(sf)
library(rerddapXtracto)
```

## Load boundary coordinates 

The shapefile for the Longhurst marine provinces includes a list of regions.  For this exercise, we will only use the boundary of one province, the Gulf Stream region ("GFST"). 

```{r read province boundaries from shapefiles}

# Set directory path
dir_path <- '../resources/longhurst_v4_2010/'

# Import shape files (Longhurst coordinates)
shapes <- read_sf(dsn = dir_path, layer = "Longhurst_world_v4_2010")

# Example List of all the province names
shapes$ProvCode

# Get boundary coordinates for Gulf Stream region (GFST)
GFST <- shapes[shapes$ProvCode == "GFST",]

xcoord <- st_coordinates(GFST)[,1]
ycoord <- st_coordinates(GFST)[,2]

```

## Get a vector of urls to our nc files

```{r}
edl_netrc()
with_gdalcubes()
```

```{r}
short_name <- 'AVHRR_OI-NCEI-L4-GLOB-v2.1'
bbox <- c(xmin=min(xcoord), ymin=min(ycoord), xmax=max(xcoord), ymax=max(ycoord)) 
tbox <- c("2020-01-16", "2020-12-16")

results <- edl_search(
    short_name = short_name,
    version = "2.1",
    temporal = tbox,
    bounding_box = paste(bbox,collapse=",")
)
```

There are `r length(results)` files.

## Crop and plot one image


```{r}
library(terra)
ras <- terra::rast(results[1], vsi=TRUE)
e <- ext(c(min(xcoord), max(xcoord),  min(ycoord), max(ycoord) ))
rc <- crop(ras, e)
```

This has the following layers.
```{r}
names(rc)
```

```{r}
plot(rc[["analysed_sst"]])
```

## Apply a mask 

Apply mask to a terra raster.

## Create a data cube

We will create a data cube so that we can compute daily means over the polygon.

## Mask the polygon 


### Plot the data


### Plot the mean seasonal temperature for the province

Not sure how to do this part.

```{r}
sst_mean=apply(satdata$sea_surface_temperature,3,mean,na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
plot(satdata$time,sst_mean,main='Gulf Stream Province Monthly Mean Temperature 2020',ylab='SSt (ÂºC)',xlab='',type='b')
```
