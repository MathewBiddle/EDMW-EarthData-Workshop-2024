title: Setting up on your computer - Python users

The easiest way to run the Python tutorials locally is to use a Docker container. A Dockerfile is included in the repo for this purpose. You'll need containerization software such as [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) installed.

First clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024) to your local computer. Using a command line terminal, navigate to a directory where you wish to download the repo, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/EDMW-EarthData-Workshop-2024.git
```

Make sure Docker or Podman is running, then build the container:

```bash
docker build -t "pygeospatial:Dockerfile" .
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you're using Podman, simply replace `docker` with `podman` in this command and any that follow.

The `-t` flag assigns a tag to the container. This can be anything; here it is "pygeospatial:Dockerfile". This step may take awhile the first time you run it. It is downloading a pre-configured image from [NMFS Open Science Docker Stack](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/container-images), setting up the Python environment, then copying the EDMW EarthData Workshop repo contents into the container.

When the build finishes, run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8888:8888 pygeospatial:Dockerfile
```

At the end of the printout in the terminal window, you will see instructions for how to access the server (`To access the server...`). Copy and paste either of the URLs into a web browser. You should be greeted with a JupyterLab dashboard as in the live demo. The Python tutorials are in the `python` directory.
